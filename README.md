## The Problem
It can be really hard to build habits, and people often fail if not provided with the right insentives. What is better than competition!

## Outcomes
This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- Express implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a functional API that follows those criteria
- The use of API's and handling their data
- A deeper understanding of Heroku deployments
- A deeper understanding of Handlebars
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it
- A deeper understanding of MySQL and using Express to manipulate a database

## Installation

This project is deployed on heroku through the following link:

## Usage

This project can be used as proof of concept for a site that can allow the addition and management of items to track score, and that will fill that data to a leaderbaord. To test the site we recommend using the username: smr@yahoo.com.au and password: password12345 and then the username: mohamed@gmail.com and the password: password12345
